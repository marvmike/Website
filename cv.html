 <h1><b>About me</b></h1>
 I am a responsible, results-oriented, focused, curious, and incrediably Self-aware person.<br>
 Over years, I have learnt how to work with others in group projects and how it is important to listen and understand others. <br>
 I work in an organized manner and try to be able to balance both my studies and work well enough. <br>
 I am keen to continue learning and would be even more happy learning new skills at the same time as gaining practical experience. <br>
