    <h2><b>Work process</b></h2>
<p>
    I have previously done some basic HTML and CSS as a course work and on my own but that was a long time again, relatively speaking, 
    and coming back to it i found myself going through the same or similar resources, form the classwork to 
    former websites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">For CSS</a> , or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp"> For HTML</a>.
